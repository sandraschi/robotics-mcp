## 🎯 **The "Architect First" Principle**

**Before writing a single line of code, let AI be your research architect.** Build comprehensive domain knowledge through systematic information gathering. Implementation becomes dramatically easier with a solid research foundation.

### **Why Research First?**
- **Avoid dead ends** - Know which approaches actually work
- **Understand constraints** - Technical limitations become clear upfront
- **Find communities** - Connect with experienced developers
- **Discover alternatives** - Multiple solution paths emerge
- **Save time** - Don't reinvent solutions that already exist
- **Reduce risk** - Make informed technical decisions

### **Traditional vs. AI-Research Workflow:**

#### **Traditional Approach:**
```
1. Have idea
2. Start coding immediately
3. Hit roadblocks
4. Research frantically
5. Rewrite code multiple times
6. Eventually find good solution
```

#### **AI-Research Approach:**
```
1. Have idea
2. AI research phase (comprehensive)
3. Clear technical path identified
4. Implementation follows known best practices
5. Smooth development with fewer roadblocks
6. Higher success rate
```

## 🧠 **AI Research Workflow (4-Phase Process)**

### **Phase 1: Domain Mapping**
**Understand the ecosystem and landscape**

```
Prompt AI: "Map the [DOMAIN] ecosystem for [APPLICATION]"
- Standards organizations and specifications
- Official repositories and documentation
- Current limitations and workarounds
- Industry best practices and patterns
- Success stories and case studies
- Regulatory considerations and compliance
```

**Example:** `"Map the robotics middleware ecosystem for Unity integration"`

### **Phase 2: Tool & Technology Discovery**
**Find all relevant tools, libraries, and frameworks**

```
Prompt AI: "Find all [TECHNOLOGY] tools and libraries for [PLATFORM]"
- Official SDKs and APIs
- Community libraries and frameworks
- Alternative implementations
- Integration tools and bridges
- Development environments and IDEs
- Testing and debugging tools
```

**Example:** `"Find all computer vision libraries for real-time robot navigation"`

### **Phase 3: Community Intelligence**
**Research communities, forums, and support networks**

```
Prompt AI: "Research [DOMAIN] communities and resources"
- GitHub repositories with examples
- Stack Overflow and technical forums
- Subreddits and specialized communities
- Discord servers and Slack channels
- YouTube channels and tutorial creators
- Academic papers and research groups
- Industry blogs and newsletters
```

**Example:** `"Research computer vision communities for robotics applications"`

### **Phase 4: Web Scraping Integration**
**Systematically collect comprehensive information**

```
Prompt AI: "Use web scraping to collect comprehensive [DOMAIN] information"
- Scrape official documentation sites
- Collect community forum discussions
- Gather tutorial links and resources
- Extract code examples and snippets
- Build knowledge base of best practices
- Monitor for latest developments
```

**Example:** `"Use web scraping to collect ROS2 Unity integration examples"`

## 🕷️ **Web Scraping as Research Tool**

### **Tool Selection Strategy:**

#### **BrightData MCP Tools (Premium):**
- **Best for:** Restricted sites, CAPTCHAs, EU popups, geo-blocks
- **Use when:** Need to access locked documentation or forums
- **Cost:** Freemium ($5 free credits, then pay-as-you-go)
- **Strengths:** Bypasses all entry barriers automatically

#### **Fetch MCP Tool (Free):**
- **Best for:** Open websites, GitHub, documentation sites
- **Use when:** Sites are accessible without restrictions
- **Cost:** Completely free

### **Scraping Strategy by Content Type:**

| Content Type | Primary Tool | Secondary Tool | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| **GitHub repos** | Fetch | Manual | Most repos are accessible |
| **Official docs** | Fetch | BrightData | Some docs have restrictions |
| **Forums/Reddit** | BrightData | Manual | Often have anti-bot measures |
| **Research papers** | Fetch | BrightData | Some require subscriptions |
| **Tutorials** | Fetch | Manual | Usually open access |
| **APIs/SDKs** | Fetch | BrightData | Documentation may be restricted |
